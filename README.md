# Lean Game Maker

This library renders structured Lean files into an interactive game with a javascript Lean server running on the browser.
See the [Natural number game](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/) for an implementation of this game.

The games built with this library work best in Chrome and Firefox.
